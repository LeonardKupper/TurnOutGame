# Ideas

## General game structure

* [ ] add field of view and give every unit a specific visibility
* [ ] add Classes: Tank, Damage, Support
* [ ] game ends when one team only has an Defender/Mountain

## Units

### Tank

* [x] Mountain (currently Defender): is slow but indestrucible
* [ ] Bricklayer: can set up to 3 individual indestructible blocks that break after X rounds


### Support

* [x] Runner: is really fast (maybe make him faster than the spotter)
* [ ] Spotter: is fast and has a high field of view
* [ ] Trapper: can set up to 3 traps that stun the opponent for 1 round
* [ ] Lurker: can look around corners without getting into the line of fire
* [ ] Stalker: his field of view goes straight ahead to the next obstacle


### Damage

* [x] Sniper (currently Striker): can fire a beam to the next obstacle
* [x] Dasher (or maybe Dagger?): can attack one of the two diagonal squares in front of him (Buff idea: Increase attack range by 1 field)
* [ ] Self-Destructor: can explode itself to kill all in the radius (maybe respawns then?)
* [ ] Bishop: can run diagonally (like a bishop in chess) and attack 1 square in front of itself


## Maps

## Design

* dark background, neon colors, futuristic
